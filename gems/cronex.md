An ecosystem token offering fee sharing from multiple utilities. It started with the release of the dex, for which it is named. 

Starting with fees from Cyclone, a fork of Tornado Cash for the Cronos chain and soon other yet to be announced utilities as well.

It is a no nonsense, no minting, no ponzi token with a low 3% tax that will be lowered in time. Buying it and holding it, is buying and holding a piece of an expanding ecosystem.
